# GuildMaster

The repository has been cleaned to restart GuildMaster as a fresh Godot project. All previous web assets and build tooling have been removed so the game can be rebuilt entirely inside the Godot editor.

## Getting started with Godot
1. Install Godot 4.x.
2. Open this repository folder in Godot; the provided `project.godot` file will be detected automatically.
3. Configure your scenes, scripts, and assets as you rebuild the game.
4. Add export presets in the Godot editor when you are ready to produce builds.

## Repository layout
- `project.godot` – minimal project definition to bootstrap the new Godot workspace.
- `.gitignore` – ignores Godot import caches and other local artifacts.

Feel free to create new directories (such as `scenes/`, `scripts/`, or `assets/`) as you start the new implementation.
